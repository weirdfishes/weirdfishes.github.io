# Video Games

I've been playing video games since I can remember. These are some of my favorites.

<!-- 0. Tactics Ogre: Reborn
  This one is still in progress, but based on what I've played, I know it's gonna make the list. Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a fantastic turn based SRPG with great quality of life updates to make it really approachable for all. On top of having fun engaging battles, the story and voice acting are top notch. Major choices that you make have real weight and alter the course of the story.
