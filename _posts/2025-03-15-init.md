I decided to make this site (and blog) for a few different reasons.

A while back, I encountered a blog post on Hacker News titled [This page is under construction](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-page-is-under-construction/). 

The post harkened back to the days of the old web, before platforms and algorithms took over. You know, back when there were more than four websites that you would visit at a given time. More importantly, it reminded me of the days of editing my MySpace profile to use a shitty animated mouse pointer, adding YouTube videos that autoplayed music when an unlucky soul visited my page, and just the generally unpredictable & wacky nature of the web.

I have recently been jotting down thoughts using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), when I had the idea of using markdown files as a framework for a website. After a little bit of googling, I learned about Jekyll, which I now use to power the site along with Github Pages. Unfortunately the setup was more painful than expected. I may write a future post about this.

Finally, this gives me an excuse to practice writing. I now strongly believe that effective reading and writing are among the strongest skills one can have in any facet of life, even software development.

Ideally, this site will fill up with my thoughts on travels, books, [games](/games), and more.
